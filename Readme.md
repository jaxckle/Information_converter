This project was inspired by an extra credit assignment by my IB compsci HL teacher.
The assignment was to make 2 functions that could convert binary to decimal and hexidecimal.
I desided to make all 6 functions and to make the project more advanced I desided t add an AI classifying system to practice my ML skills.
The app can guess if the user inputs binary, decimal, or hexidecimal with a 94% accuracy.
